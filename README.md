## 🔍 Overview

This system is a **low-cost AI-powered alert system** designed for cyclists to detect rear-approaching vehicles and provide real-time audio-visual warnings. Combining **YOLOv5** object detection and **MonoDepth2** depth estimation, the device boosts situational awareness and helps reduce road accidents.

## 🚦 How It Works

1. USB camera captures rear road view.
2. YOLOv5 detects vehicles in real time.
3. MonoDepth2 estimates distance using a single frame.
4. If distance ≤ 3m, alerts are triggered.
5. App displays warnings and audio feedback.

## 🔧 Limitations

- ⚠️ Not optimized for night/dark conditions
- ⚠️ Rear-only detection (no lateral/frontal awareness)
- ⚠️ Mild delays under heavy traffic
- ⚠️ Thermal throttling in extended sessions

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

🔗 Add V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) comms  
🎯 360° detection with multi-camera or LiDAR  
💡 Infrared support for night vision  
🚀 Raspberry Pi 5 upgrade for better performance  
📡 Sensor fusion (e.g., radar + camera)
